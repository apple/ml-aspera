        referenced in the event fields should exist in the company directory

    Parameters
    ----------
    employee
        The employee whose calendar needs to be created. The employee
        should exist in the company directory (ie the name of the employee
        should be passed to `simulate_org_structure`).
    events
        The events in the employee's calendar. `employee` should not be
        part of any fields of type list[Employee] because they own the calendar.

    Notes
    -----
    1. The employee owning the calendar should not be included in `attendees`.
    2. When creating calendars for multiple employees, ensure events are
    consistent among them.
    3. Any employees referenced in event fields should also exist in the
    company directory. Use `simulate_employee_profile` to create them.
