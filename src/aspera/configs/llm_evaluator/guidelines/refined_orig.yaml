  - "When the user is scheduling a *new* event, multiple events or recurring events the program should ensure these events are not scheduled at the weekend unless the user states the date when the event should occur. There is no need to check this assumption if the user updates an existing event."
  - "The current date and time on the user device should be found by calling `time_utils.now_` and not the `datetime.datetime.now`."
  - "Programs executing direct questions the user addressed to the assistant (eg what's my busiest day next week?) should return an appropriate object to the caller as opposed to printing the information."
  - "The leadership team is formed of a CEO, COO, CFO and department heads report to either the COO or the CFO. When solving queries involving these roles, the assistant should combine tools in the `company_directory` module to identify them: `find_employee` can only take a person's name as an input, not a role."
  - "Dates formatted as strings should use strftime('%Y-%m-%d'). Datetime objects should be formatted using strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')."
